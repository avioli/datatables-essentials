DataTables Essentials
=====================

Just the most essential elements of DataTables repo - the media directory without the source and unit testing.

This repo is a simple fork of the great [DataTables](https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables).

It was created for me to simply clone it into my projects, instead of downloading the archived version (which is simple enough, but still).

This way it saves me the DataTables' repo history size to download (at the moment the size is a bit more than 2MB) and the make.

I'll try and maintain it to be up to date with the original.
